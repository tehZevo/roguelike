as you go up/down the tree, dungeon changes size

servers auto generate:
  client connects to main(login) server
  client logs in
  main server connects client to "town" game server
  client requests dungeon "forest" (floor 1)
  town game server asks main server for location (host/port) of server running "forest floor 1"
  main server does not have location of any "forest floor 1" rooms, so it asks a game server to create that room

implement webpack on client
combine client + server code with webpack build for client
